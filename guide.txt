how to use Bitbucket with AWS SageMaker notebooks:
Sign up for a Bitbucket account if you don't have one already.
Create a new repository in Bitbucket that will hold your SageMaker notebook files. You can do this by clicking on the "+" sign in the left-hand navigation bar, then selecting "Repository."
In SageMaker, create a new notebook instance or use an existing one.
In the SageMaker Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the folder where you want to create your new notebook.
Click the "New" button, then select "Terminal" from the dropdown menu.
In the terminal window, navigate to the folder where you want to create your new notebook and run the following command to clone your Bitbucket repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with the HTTPS or SSH URL of your Bitbucket repository. You can find this URL on the Bitbucket repository page.
After the repository is cloned, navigate back to the Jupyter Notebook interface.
Refresh the page and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository. You should see the notebook files in the folder.
To make changes to the notebooks, open them in the SageMaker Jupyter Notebook interface and edit them as needed.
When you're ready to save your changes, navigate back to the terminal window and run the following commands to commit and push your changes to Bitbucket:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
Replace "Commit message" with a brief description of the changes you made.
Your changes should now be pushed to your Bitbucket repository.
